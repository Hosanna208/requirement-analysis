# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process is important because it ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and complete understanding of what the software system should do and it should perform before the design and implementation begin.
