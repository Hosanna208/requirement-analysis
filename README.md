# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process ensures that the development team has a clear and complete understanding of what the software system should do before design and implementation begin.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to define both functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements describe what the system should do (e.g., booking a service), while non-functional requirements define how the system should perform (e.g., speed, security, scalability).

The main objectives of requirement analysis are:
- To ensure all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system's goals.
- To identify any conflicting requirements early in the process.
- To create a solid foundation for system design and development.

Effective requirement analysis reduces the risk of project failure, scope creep, and costly redesigns by promoting clarity, alignment, and feasibility from the outset.
